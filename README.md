# Assault cube external hack

I've always wanted to learn about computer memory and assembly, and what's a funner way to do that than write a video game hack?

The hack is made with [this](https://github.com/assaultcube/AC/releases/tag/v1.3.0.2) version of assauly cube, and it only works with singleplayer. LMao.

More info on how the hack works can be read via the [docs](docs.md) or through reading the source of the cheat.
